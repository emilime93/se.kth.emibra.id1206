=== Startup & MBR ===
1. First the computer will do some system testing.
2. The BIOS looks for the primary disk and the MBR (Master Boot Record).
   This is the first 512 bytes of the disk.
3. The MBR will probably start executing a boot loader (or any other larger program)

=== BOOT LOADER ===
- Knows about file system
- GRUB is a bootloader

=== Operating System ===
Now a OS will take over the system and:
- Switch to 64-bit mode
- Create a stack
- Set up the interrupt descriptor table
- Initialize the virtual memory
- Organize the task scheduler
- Set up the File System
......
A large OS is divided into modules, and only some are needed to boot.
